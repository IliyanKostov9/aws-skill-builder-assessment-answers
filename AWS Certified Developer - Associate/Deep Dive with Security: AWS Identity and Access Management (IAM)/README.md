#### A solutions architect is deploying an application on Amazon EC2, which must call AWS APIs. What method should they use to securely pass credentials to the application?

- Pass API credentials to the instance using instance user data.
- Store API credentials as an object in an Amazon S3 bucket.
- Embed the API credentials into the application.
> - Assign an IAM role to the EC2 instance.


#### Which of the following is NOT a feature of AWS Security Token Service?

- AWS STS enables users to request temporary limited-privilege credentials.
- AWS STS enables users to assume a role.
> - AWS STS enables users to request Git credentials.

- Access keys are embedded in the AWS Lambda function.
- The IAM user password is embedded in the AWS Lambda function.


#### A company is building a new application and is hosting their development, test, and production applications on Amazon EC2 instances. Administrators for each of the environments will need access to their environment but not to the other environments.

> - Add tags to the instances and IAM policies to mark each environment. 
- Add user data to the underlying instances to mark each environment.
- Add metadata to the underlying instances to mark each environment.
